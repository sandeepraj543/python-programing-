# write a python program that takes your age as input and print the value entered and its type.

# age= int(input("Enter your age:"))

# Test in existing keywords as variable NameError, and find error. 

# for = 5
# and = "hello"
# print(for)
# print(and)
# print(type(for))
# print(type(and))

# the above code will give a syntax error because 'for''and' is a reserved keyword in python.

# write a python program to take 2 input and print their sum.

# number1 = int(input("Enter first number : "))

# sum = number1 + number2
# print("The sum is number1 and number2 is :", sum)

# write a python program to take 2 input numbers and print their average.
