# practice question 1 
# Write a python program that takes a number as input from the user and prints 
# “Positive” if number > 0
# “Zero” if number == 0
# “Negative” if number < 0


# num = float(input("Enter any number(+ve,0,-ve):"))

# if num > 0:
#     print("The number" , num , " is positive.")
# elif num == 0:
#     print("The number" , num ,  " is Zero.")
# else:
#     print("The number" , num , " is Negative.")


# # practice question 2
# # write a program that takes names of 3 favourite food items from the user and print them as a list.

# food1 = input("Enter your first favourite food item :")
# food2 = input("Enter your second favourite food item :")
# food3 = input("Enter your third favourite food item :")

# # first way-
# # food_list = [food1, food2, food3]
# # print("your favourite food items are :", food_list)

# # second way-
# food_list = []
# food_list.append(food1)   # .append()function is used to add items to the list.
# food_list.append(food2)
# food_list.append(food3)
# print("your favourite food items are :", food_list)


# practice question 3
# write a program to creat a favorite five fruit and prints 
# total number of fruits
# the index of one selected fruits

# fav_fruits = ("mango","banana","apple","orange","papaya")
# print(len(fav_fruits))
# print(fav_fruits.index("banana"))

# practice assignment :-

# question no-1, Ask the user for their 3 favorite movies and store them in a list.

# movie_list1 = input("Enter your 1st favourite movie name: ")
# movie_list2 = input("Enter your 2nd favourite movie name: ")
# movie_list3 = input("Enter your 3rd favourite movie name: ")

# fav_movie_list = [movie_list1,movie_list2,movie_list3] 
# print("your favourite movie list are :-",fav_movie_list)

# question no-2, Create a tuple of marks (87, 64, 33, 95, 76) and print the highest and
# lowest marks using max() and min().

# marks = (87,64,33,95,76)
# max = max(marks)
# min = min(marks)
# print("highest marks :", max)
# print("lowest marks :", min)

# question no-3, write a program to check grade based on marks (A/B/C/D)  using if-else statement.

# marks = float(input("Enter your marks:-"))

# if marks >= 90:
#     print(" your grade is A ")

# elif marks >= 80:
#     print("your grade is B ")

# elif marks >= 70:
#     print("your grade is C ")

# elif marks >= 60:
#     print("your grade is D ")

# else:
#     print("improvement needed: ")
